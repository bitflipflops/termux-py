*** Wrapper library to make termux easy to work with my style of python
Tries to use only the std library, because termux can be a pain to deal with pip

** Core functions
- [ ] Notifications
  This is the main functionality I want, so I can have an easy way to ping me when I am out and about. 
- [ ] Vibrate
  I am interested in writing a library the sends messages through morse code through vibration patterns
- [ ] Dialog
  I want to be able to have little date entry scripts that use this, for tracking my exercise, shopping lists, etc
